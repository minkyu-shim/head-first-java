METHOD String checkYourself(int userGuess)
	GET the user guess as an int parameter
	REPEAT with each of the location cells in the int array
		// COMPARE the user guess to the location cell
		IF user guess == locationCells
			INCREMENT the numberOfHits
			// FIND OUT if it was the last location cell
			IF number of hits is 3, RETURN "kill" as the result
			ELSE it was not a kill, so RETURN "hit"
			END IF
